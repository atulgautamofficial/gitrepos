Git hub command line interface commonly used commands - 

-->  makdir gitrepo
-->  cd gitrepo
-->  git init                   Initailize empty git repo in gitrepo directory


-->  touch file1.text
-->  ls -lrt          or   -->  ll
-->  git status


Staging(Indexing) and Commit(To save on local box) 

-->  git add . 			Staging(Indexing) all files in current directory or folder
-->  git status

If not login on bash

-->  git config --global user email "atulgautamofficial@gmail.com"
Give access to this mail id as admin and to push on this server ID

Commit

-->  git commit -m "First Commit (any name can be given)"	Commited on local box1 (Disk)
-->  git status

Push on remote box (server of Git-hub)

-->  git remote add origin LINK		LINK-	Copy from website repository link
-->  git push -u origin master		Pushed on remote server in master node (Trunk-main line)


Now our file1.txt has been uploaded. 
Now lets make another file2.txt and upload on same repository of remote server.

-->  touch file2.txt
-->  git add .
-->  git commit -m "Second Commit"
-->  git remote add origin
-->  git push -u origin master			or 	git push URL master			URL can be copied from website
-->  git remote -v			Will give full path for Pull(fetch)/Push


Here file2.text also has been uploaded to remote server.
Now lets make some modification on file2.txt and upload on branch node instead of master node.

Branching

-->  git fetch
-->  git checkout -b mybranch (any name of branch)
-->  git branch			output - master and mybranch (Only on local box2) - need to update server also
-->  git  push origin mybranch			Will update the server as mybranch branch node

Modifications on file (Do some modifications on file2.txt)

-->  vim file2.txt			Use to modify or write file2.txt (Do not use and do it manually)
-->  git status
-->  git add .
-->  git commit -m "file2.txt modified"
-->  git push origin mybranch		Pushed on branch node (mybranch) on server ID

Pulling on master node (Merge master & mybranch) after apporval (Will do admin only)
